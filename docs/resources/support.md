# Support

If you find any bugs or unexpected behavior, please open an issue. If you require a missing functionality, opening an issue can also help to determine if the project can be extended in this direction.

It is always helpful if you could provide a working code snippet of your application that reproduces the problem. This enables quickly identifying the cause of the error by copying and pasting it into another system.
