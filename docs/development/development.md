Dive into the hands-on process of building applications, from coding and UI design to debugging.


::: tip **Keep models *concise* and *comprehensible***

As said in the *["Keep it simple, stupid!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KISS_principle&oldid=992997588)* Wikipedia entry: *"... most systems work best if they're kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicity) should be a key goal in [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design), and unnecessary complexity should be avoided."*

::: warning **Avoid overly abstract models**

Even though domain models should abstract from technical implementations, don't overstress this and balance it with ease of adoption. For example if the vast majority of your clients use relational databases, don't try to overly abstract from that, as that would have all suffer from common denominator syndromes.
