# Errors

#### Assert 
A pragmatic apporach is to work with an assert, tho I how ABAP throws all his exceptions 


#### Uncatched Exception
Goes into the default of the http handler not showing any error

#### Catched Exception with Message Box
Raise exception with catch
More elegant as you can stay with 

#### Popup Exception
PRs Welcome
