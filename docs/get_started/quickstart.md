```abap [ABAP]
CLASS zcl_my_handler_onprem DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  CREATE PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_http_extension.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_my_handler_onprem IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD if_http_extension~handle_request.

    z2ui5_cl_http_handler=>factory( server )->main( ).

  ENDMETHOD.

ENDCLASS.
```

```abap [ABAP Cloud]
CLASS zcl_my_handler_cloud DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  CREATE PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    INTERFACES if_http_service_extension.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_my_handler_cloud IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD if_http_service_extension~handle_request.

    z2ui5_cl_http_handler=>factory( req = request res = response )->main( ).

  ENDMETHOD.

ENDCLASS.

::: warning Security

The project does not connect to external systems. It communicates solely with the HTTP handler that you define. You are in complete controlâ€”decide who can access this handler and establish custom authentication methods. As your needs evolve, you can further refine the handler as you can see [here.](/configuration/general)
