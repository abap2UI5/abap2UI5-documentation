# Introduction

Welcome to abap2UI5 â€“ an open-source framework that allows you to develop UI5 apps purely in ABAP.

#### Why abap2UI5?
This project offers a pure ABAP approach for developing UI5 apps - entirely without JavaScript, OData or RAP. Just like in the past, when a few lines of ABAP were enough to display input forms and tables using Selection Screens & ALVs. Designed with a minimal system footprint, it works in both on-premise and cloud environments.

#### Key Features

* **100% ABAP:** Developing purely in ABAP (no JavaScript, DDL, EML or Customizing)
* **User-Friendly:** Implement a single interface to create a standalone UI5 application
* **Minimal System Footprint:** Uses a simple HTTP handler (no BSP, OData, CDS or RAP)
* **Cloud & On-Premise Ready:** Supports both ABAP Cloud and Standard ABAP
* **Broad System Compatibility:** Runs on all ABAP releases (from NW 7.02 to ABAP Cloud)
* **Easy Installation:** Install via abapGit, no additional app deployment required

#### Compatibility

* BTP ABAP Environment (ABAP for Cloud)
* S/4 Public Cloud (ABAP for Cloud)
* S/4 Private Cloud or On-Premise (ABAP for Cloud, Standard ABAP)
* R/3 NetWeaver AS ABAP 7.50 or higher (Standard ABAP)
